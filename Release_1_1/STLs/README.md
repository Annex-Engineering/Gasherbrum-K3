# STL Options

Subfolders containing multiple variants of each part will generally contain a README file that lists which files you need to print for each option. The following sections explain file labels that apply to all STL subfolders in general.

## Extrusion Variants

Extrusions can be tapped as either M5 or M6. Parts with "(m6_thread)" in the filename are meant for extrusions tapped as M6, and parts with the same filename but missing this label are meant for extrusions tapped as M5.

## XY Motor Variants

K3 can be built either with standard motors with a shaft and coupling, or with custom long shaft motors from LDO. Parts with "(custom_LDO_motor_option)" in the filename are meant for use with the custom LDO motors, and parts with the same filename but missing this label are meant for use with standard motors.
