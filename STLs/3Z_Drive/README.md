If you are using the 2-piece z drives and the cross bar, you will have to print a differenty quantity of each part:

Ignore these files:
- z_drive_2_piece_rear_lower_x1_rev1.stl
- z_drive_2_piece_rear_upper_(6201_option)_x1_rev1.stl
- z_drive_2_piece_rear_upper_(thrust_option)_x1_rev1.stl

Instead, print 1 extra of each of these:
- z_drive_2_piece_front_lower_x1_rev1.stl
- z_drive_2_piece_front_upper_(6201_option)_x1_rev1.stl or z_drive_2_piece_front_upper_(thrust_option)_x1_rev1.stl

You will also need 1 less of this:
- z_motor_tensioner_screw_mount_x2_EXPERIMENTAL_rev1.stl

And instead replace it with 1 extra of this:
- z_motor_tensioner_screw_mount_mirror_x1_EXPERIMENTAL_rev1.stl

The current version of the edrawing shows the rear z drive on the right side of the cross bar, but it should be on the left side (and the leadscrew should be to the left of the rail). We will update the edrawing soon.
