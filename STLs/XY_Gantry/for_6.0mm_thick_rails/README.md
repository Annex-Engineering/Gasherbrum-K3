If you are using robotdigg rails, you will have to use these modified stls for the tensioner spacer and rail mounts since the rails are 0.5mm thinner.
- Before printing the tensioner spacer, try slicing the main toolhead plate (with whatever settings you will/did use to print it) and check the distance from the bottom to the surface that sits underneath the upside-down rail.
- Try slicing the tensioner spacer, and make sure its sliced height from top to bottom is 14.0mm more than your measurement from the toolhead plate.
    - For example, if the thickness on the toolhead plate ends up being 6.6mm, then your tensioner spacer should end up being 20.6mm tall.
- Scale the tensioner spacer (in the z axis only) if it is the wrong size when sliced.
